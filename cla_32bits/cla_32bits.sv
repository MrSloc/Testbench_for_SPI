// I am trying to create a Verilog model for a 32-bit Carry-Lookahead Adder (CLA). The module name must be cla_32bits. It must meet the following specifications:

// Inputs:

// a: A 32-bit input vector.

// b: A 32-bit input vector.

// ci: A 1-bit carry-in.

// Outputs:

// s: A 32-bit output vector representing the sum.

// co: A 1-bit carry-out.

// The design must implement the carry-lookahead logic. This involves calculating propagate (p) and generate (g) signals for each bit slice and then using them to compute the carries for all bit positions. The final sum s should be calculated based on the input bits and the computed carries.

// How would I write a Verilog design that meets these specifications?

module cla_4bit_block (
    input  [3:0] a,
    input  [3:0] b,
    input        ci,       // Carry-in to this block
    output [3:0] s,
    output       P,        // Group Propagate
    output       G         // Group Generate
);

//Insert Codes

endmodule
